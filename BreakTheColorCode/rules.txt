*********** OBJECT ***********
Guess the "secret code" and become the Lord of Brains! 

The code is a sequence of four colored pegs chosen by the computer.

The pegs come in six colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue & purple.


********* GAME PLAY *********
Guess a configuration of four pegs at each row, starting at the bottom row.

Click each peg to cycle through the six colors. When you are
satisfied with the row, click "Submit" to enter your guess.

The computer will give you "feedback" on the accuracy of your guess:
- a black peg indicates a peg of the right color in the right position
- a white peg indicates a peg of the right color, but the wrong position
Use this feedback to choose your guess for the next row.

Your goal is to match the secret code exactly before reaching the top row.


********** SCORING **********
Low scores are better. 
Your score goes up one point for each incorrect guess/row. 

You win if you match the code exactly before running out of rows.
You lose if you get to the top of the board without guessing the code.
